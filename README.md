iframes and media-queries don't get along well...  
...so [i fixed it](https://github.com/cdeath/same-breakpoint-iframes/).

here you'll find two solutions for consistent breakpoint across iframes:

- a pure css solution  
  [code](https://github.com/cdeath/same-breakpoint-iframes/tree/main/pure-css), [demo](https://cdeath.github.io/same-breakpoint-iframes/pure-css)
- a javascript solution with postMessage  
  [code](https://github.com/cdeath/same-breakpoint-iframes/tree/main/javascript-postmessage), [demo](https://cdeath.github.io/same-breakpoint-iframes/javascript-postmessage)

have fun!
